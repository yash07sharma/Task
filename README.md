# Description
 
 A basic P2P blockchain network using websockets.

# Setup and use
 
 First check if *node* and *git* are installed, then :
```bash
     clone the directory 
     cd TheChain 
     npm i
``` 
 Next, you need to open two terminals and run
```bash
    node peer
```
 and

```bash
    node peer2
```


  **What just happened on the terminals :** The ***peer*** is creating a transaction which the ***peer2*** is mining on the blockchain.
